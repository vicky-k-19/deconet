# DECONET
Code for the experiments accompanying the publication "DECONET: an Unfolding Network for Analysis-based Compressed Sensing with Generalization Error Bounds", to appear in IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing.

The repo consists of the following 4 .py files: 
a) `deconet_mnist.py` builds the DECONET model, which is then trained and tested on the MNIST dataset
b) `deconet_cifar.py` builds the DECONET model, which is then trained and tested on the CIFAR10 dataset
c) `synthetic_dataset.py` creates synthetic data drawn from the normal distribution
d) `deconet_synthetic.py` builds the DECONET model, which is then trained and tested on the synthetic dataset created in (c)
